            <h2>Virtual Reality is the next TV</h2>
            <p><img src="VR.jpg" alt="Virtualy reality headset"></p>
            <p>Virtual reality is the future of entertainment.As of right now VR tech is expensive and not many people own any. The people that do I would say are mostly gamers at that as VR headsets are wily used for video games right now, but there capabilities are so much more. Some sports have tapped into the VR market with cameras that record for VR and allow people to watch clips and games in VR. I believe that once the VR tech itself becomes cheaper and more affordable they will start to appear in most households just like the TV did. Once that happens the VR market will be huge and the amount of opportunities with VR will rise. One of those being the sports market that would be able to Sell tickets to watch sporting events though VR. Giving the people at home watching a more emersed experience rather than just watching on the couch.</p>

            <h2>Agmented reality in the workplace</h2>
            <p><img src="AR.jpg" alt="Agmented realality surgery"></p>
            <P>Augmented reality has a lot of features for the workplace. Augmented reality can be applied to almost every job out there from a mechanic to a surgeon. by displaying useful information in real time virtually right Infront of you can save time and energy. Imagine a surgeon going into surgery with his AR glasses on that allow him to see under his patient’s skin and show where he needs to cut into and the arteries around it. This would cause way less errors and allow for faster procedures. On top of that AR is looking to replace a lot of common things in day to day lives. A big example of that would be computer monitors. Once our AR tech becomes more accessible, we will replace our current monitors with augmented ones. Our computer would display its screens to us in real time over AR and allow us to type and use the computer without any physical screen Infront of us. It’s not a matter of if we will reach this point of technology it’s when it will be accessible to the public and a cheap enough rate to make it worth it.</P>
