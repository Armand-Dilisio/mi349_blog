            <P>Augmented reality has a lot of features for the workplace.

Imagine a surgeon going into surgery with his AR glasses on that allow him to see under his patientâ€™s skin and show where he needs to cut into and the arteries around it. This would cause way less errors and allow for faster procedures.</P>
